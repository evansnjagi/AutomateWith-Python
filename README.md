# AutomateWith-Python

Learning how to automate things using python.



We will learn to automate simple tasks using python. Those tasks includes but not limited to the following



* Moving, renaming and sorting thousands of files
* Filling out an online file
* Downloading text or files to your phone
* Updating and formatting excel spreadsheets
* Checking your email as well as sending pre-written responses
* Creating and querying databases
* Extracting text and images from audio files.



Important terms:



1. **Programming -** Written instructions to a computer to do a specific task. These instructions are written in a language the computer understands.

**2. Expression -** It's a single value evaluation that always consist of a value and an operator



Variable names should describe the data type it contains and should be simple to understand. A variable therefore, is like a container or box in computer memory where you can store a single value. In python we use assignment statements (=) to assign a variable. \*\*Note\*\* Variable names can not have the following:



&nbsp;	- Can't have spaces

&nbsp;	- Can't begin with a number

&nbsp;	- Can't be a python keyword.

Remember that variable names are case sensitive. There are two mostly used cases to separate words. \*\*camelCase\*\* and \*\*snake\_case\*\* 



What happens under the hood? Computers use binary(base-2) number system because hardware can easily represent two stages. A bit is the smallest data unit (0,1) while a byte has 8 bits. A byte represents 256 values. From there the storage grows exponentially *from Kb($2^10$), Mb($2^20$),Gb($2^30$),Tb($2^40$) and so on.*





\## Flow control.



A program is a series of instructions and in most cases we don't want the program to excude all lines of code. This is where flow control comes in. Flow control statements decide which python instructions to execute under certain conditions.
